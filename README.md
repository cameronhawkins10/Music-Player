# MP3 Player Project

Welcome to my Music Player project! This was the third JavaScript challenge I completed using freeCodeCamp's curriculum! In this project, I explored essential string and array methods like `find()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, and `join()` while developing a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I delved into fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, and implementing functionalities like play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle. Additionally, I learned how to dynamically update the user interface based on the current song.
